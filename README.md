# OpenGL Solar System Project

This project is a 3D simulation of the Solar System, created using OpenGL. It demonstrates the rendering of planets, their orbits, and a simple camera system to view the scene from different angles.

## Features
- **3D planets**: Models for each planet in the Solar System.
- **Orbit simulation**: Planets orbit the Sun.
- **Camera controls**: Use the keyboard and mouse to adjust the camera position and view.
- **Lighting**: Simple lighting to simulate sunlight across the planets and their moons.

## Requirements
- OpenGL (Version 3.3 or higher recommended)
- GLFW (for window management and input handling)
- GLAD (for loading OpenGL functions)
- CMake (for building the project)
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

## Controls
- **Mouse**: Left click and drag to rotate the camera view. Right click and drag to move about. Scroll in and out to zoom.
- **W**: Switch rendering to wireframe view
- **F**: Switch rendering to the normal view
- **Y**: Enable inverted mouse controls
- **Z**: Reduce render distance
- **X**: Increase render distance
- **C**: Bring camera back to starting position and rotation
- **T**: Increase amount of planets to render
- **G**: Decrease amount of planets to render
